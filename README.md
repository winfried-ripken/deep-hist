PyTorch implementation of Histogram Layers from DeepHist: Differentiable Joint and Color Histogram Layers for Image-to-Image Translation

PyTorch modules are ready to be used (metrics & histogram layers).
Run hist_loss to produce plots and metrics for example images.

The official implementation using TensorFlow can be found [here](https://github.com/mor-avi-aharon-bgu/HueNet).
